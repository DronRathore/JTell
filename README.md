JTell
=====

A simple Java based program content profiler without using RegExpr., out of box, but a fun! :)

How to use
==========

Provide the name of a java file as a CL argument and wait for profiler to parse and show up results.

Why Coded this?
==============

One of my professor asked to code this as she needed it for her PHD thesis, and parsers are one of my interest
so it just took a day for me to code.

What are the features?
=====================

You can have any number of  nested inner classes i will tell you how many of them are, it will tell you the number of
functions in your code and the number variables that you have declared.
